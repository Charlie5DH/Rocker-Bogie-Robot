# Rocker-Bogie-Robot

Design of a mobile robot platform, based on Raspberry Pi.

The work presents the design of a mobile robot platform, based on Raspberry Pi. A study of the main components of mobile robots is carried out. The kinematic configuration of planetary mobile robots is carried out. A suspension system to overcome obstacles is presented. Basic concepts of navigation in rough terrains are introduced. A study of the autonomous navigation stages of a planetary robot is carried out. The hardware components of the platform are selected and their details and physical characteristics are displayed. The main controller and motor driver programs are explained. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used as path planning stage to provide a path free of obstacles. A trajectory generation algorithm is implemented using clothoid curves to obtain a smoother path, showing the results of the variations of orientation in the trajectory and the curves generated between the planned points. A trajectory tracking control is implemented for the robot using the Vector Field Orientation algorithm, showing the actual trajectory obtained and the error with the reference.
